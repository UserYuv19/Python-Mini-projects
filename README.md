# Data Science Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook-based data science projects:

1. **Stock Price Prediction**
2. **Red Wine Quality Analysis**

---

## 📈 Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use historical stock price data to build a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices. It includes data visualization, preprocessing, and model training using regression techniques.

### Features
- Historical stock data loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Linear Regression & LSTM model implementation
- Model evaluation and visualization

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Keras / TensorFlow

## 🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis

This project explores the physicochemical properties of red wine and builds a classification model to predict wine quality.

### Features
- Data cleaning and EDA
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution analysis of quality scores
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance evaluation metrics

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
